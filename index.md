I am a PhD student at MIT EECS, advised by [Prof. Aleksander Madry](http://madry-lab.ml/).

I work on machine learning, focusing on problems related to robustness.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Bio
I received a BS in Computer Science from Cornell University in 2014, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Ramin Zabih and Prof. Bobby Kleinberg.

Previously, I worked on understanding statistical-computational tradeoffs in high-dimensional statistics with Prof. Guy Bresler for my SM thesis at MIT.

I have interned at Waymo, Dropbox, and Google.

## Personal

I grew up in Seoul and Singapore, where I attended [SAS](https://www.sas.edu.sg/).

From 2016-18, I served in the Republic of Korea Army.

In my free time, I like working out, trying [new](https://www.loopkickstricking.com/) [sports](/assets/img/rowing.jpg), and learning physics.
